### CRUDE: Course Resource for Understanding Distributions with Excel

[**CRUDE**](https://cwendorf.github.io/BASE/CRUDE) is a simple Excel spreadsheet that displays common statistical distributions and identifies important values of the distributions. It accepts either score input (to find percentiles ranks and p values) or percentile rank input (to find critical values). It is useful for visually representing these values as part of a course in basic statistics.

### CREATE: Course Resource for Editing and Analyzing Tutorials with Excel

[**CREATE**](https://cwendorf.github.io/BASE/CREATE) is a set of simple Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations of basic statistics in traditional approaches to data analyses. It is appropriate for small data sets (such as course tutorials) and all simple research designs (such as one sample, paired samples, independent samples, one way, repeated measure, and factorial designs). Separate spreadsheets are available for raw data and summary statistics input.

### ARISE: Arelational and Relational Interval Statistics with Excel

[**ARISE**](https://cwendorf.github.io/BASE/ARISE) is a set of simple Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations and graph of both relational and arelational confidence intervals for means using raw data input. These statistics are not readily available in other statistics packages. It also provides null hypothesis significance tests for pairwise comparisons.

### EASE: Estimation Approach to Statistics with Excel

[**EASE**](https://cwendorf.github.io/BASE/EASE) is a set of simple Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations of estimation statistics. These spreadsheets calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, and standardized effect sizes. Spreadsheets and examples are available for different single-factor designs (between-subjects vs. within-subjects) and can take either raw data or summary statistics as input.
