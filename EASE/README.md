## EASE: Estimation Approach to Statistics with Excel

### Overview

[**EASE**](../EASE) is a set of simple Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations of estimation statistics. These spreadsheets calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, and standardized effect sizes. Spreadsheets and examples are available for different single-factor designs (between-subjects vs. within-subjects) and can take either raw data or summary statistics as input.

### Materials

The **EASE(D)-OneWay** module is appropriate for a one-way (single factor) between-subjects design with raw data input.

- [*EASE(D)-OneWay.xlsx*](./EASE(D)-OneWay.xlsx) - A blank version of the module
- [*EASE(D)-OneWay-Rattan.xlsx*](./EASE(D)-OneWay-Rattan.xlsx) - Analyses raw data from Rattan (2012)

The **EASE(S)-OneWay** module is appropriate for a one-way (single factor) between-subjects design with summary statistics input.

- [*EASE(S)-OneWay.xlsx*](./EASE(S)-OneWay.xlsx) - A blank version of the module
- [*EASE(S)-OneWay-Rattan.xlsx*](./EASE(S)-OneWay-Rattan.xlsx) - Analyses summary statistics from Rattan (2012)

The **EASE(D)-Repeated** module is appropriate for a one-way (single factor) within-subjects design with raw data input.

- [*EASE(D)-Repeated.xlsx*](./EASE(D)-Repeated.xlsx) - A blank version of the module
- [*EASE(D)-Repeated-Donohue.xlsx*](./EASE(D)-Repeated-Donohue.xlsx) - Analyses raw data from Donohue (2002)

The **EASE(S)-Repeated** module is appropriate for a one-way (single factor) within-subjects design with summary statistics input.

- [*EASE(S)-Repeated.xlsx*](./EASE(S)-Repeated.xlsx) - A blank version of the module
- [*EASE(S)-Repeated-Donohue.xlsx*](./EASE(S)-Repeated-Donohue.xlsx) - Analyses summary statistics from Donohue (2002)
