## Overview

<img src="EASE.jpg" alt="EASE" align="right" style="padding: 0px 0px 20px 20px;">

**EASE** is a set of simple Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations estimation statistics. These spreadsheets calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, and standardized effect sizes. Functions and examples are available for different single-factor designs (between-subjects vs. within-subjects) and can take either raw data or summary statistics as input. 

## Included Spreadsheets and Examples

The **EASE(D)-OneWay** module is appropriate for a one-way (single factor) between-subjects design with raw data input.

- [**_EASE(D)-OneWay-Rattan.xlsx_**](https://github.com/cwendorf/BASE/raw/master/EASE/EASE(D)-OneWay-Rattan.xlsx) analyses raw data from Rattan (2012).

The **EASE(S)-OneWay** module is appropriate for a one-way (single factor) between-subjects design with summary statistics input.

- [**_EASE(S)-OneWay.xlsx_**](https://github.com/cwendorf/BASE/raw/master/EASE/EASE(S)-OneWay.xlsx) is a blank version of the module.
