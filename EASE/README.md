## Overview

**EASE** is a set of simple Excel spreadsheets that provide real-time calculations estimation statistics. These spreadsheets calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, and standardized effect sizes. Functions and examples are available for different single-factor designs (between-subjects vs. within-subjects) and can take either raw data or summary statistics as input.
